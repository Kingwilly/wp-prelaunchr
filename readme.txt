Useful plugin for setting up a pre-launch site.

== Description ==

Based on [Harry's Prelaunchr](https://github.com/harrystech/prelaunchr) and discussed in greater detail on [Tim Ferriss' blog](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/21/harrys-prelaunchr-email/) Prelaunchr for WordPress helps you quickly start a viral pre-launch campaign for new companies, products and services. 

Campaigns are conducive to social sharing and rewards / prize groups can be set based on the number of people each person refers. The groups, amounts, and rewards are completely up to you to set. 

Manually add a shortcode `[prelaunchr]` to any page or post to insert the prelaunchr email sign up form.

At the end of the campaign export your results to csv for importing into your desired marketing/sales platform such as MailChimp, Campaign Monitor or Salesforce.

Contributions like translations/localizations are extremely grateful.

= Support =

Use the WordPress.org forums for community support (note we do not monitor these forums) - We cannot offer support directly for free but if you'd like to pay or donate for support we may be able to help you. 

If you spot a bug or want to contribute some code, you can of course log it on [Github](https://github.com/FindingSimple/wp-prelaunchr) instead where I can act upon it more efficiently.

If you want help with a customisation, please hire a developer!

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Prelaunchr" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.
* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.
