Useful plugin for setting up a pre-launch site.

== Description ==

Based on [Harry's Prelaunchr](https://github.com/harrystech/prelaunchr) and discussed in greater detail on [Tim Ferriss' blog](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/21/harrys-prelaunchr-email/) Prelaunchr for WordPress helps you quickly start a viral pre-launch campaign for new companies, products and services. 

The campaign is conducive to social sharing and has reward groups/levels based on the number of people each person refers. 

The groups, amounts, and rewards are completely up to you to set. 

Manually add a shortcode `[prelaunchr]` to any page or post to insert the prelaunchr email sign up form.

At the end of the campaign export your results to csv for importing into your desired marketing/sales platform such as MailChimp, Campaign Monitor or Salesforce.
